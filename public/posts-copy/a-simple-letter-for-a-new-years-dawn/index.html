  <p>In Belgium, and especially in Flanders, there’s a tradition called the “nieuwjaarsbrief” or New Year’s letter. On the first of January, children present these letters to their parents, godparents, and sometimes other family members, often reading them aloud at family gatherings. It’s a moment of warmth and gratitude, and for the children it&rsquo;s a moment of pushing through the anxiety of demonstrating their poor reading skills in order to receive their gift or envelope of cash.</p>
<p>Once you enter secondary education, you usually stop writing these letters. However, godparents typically continue to show their care by giving you gifts. Now, with both of my godparents passing away in the past eighteen months, I’m stepping into a new year without their presence.</p>
<p>Because they teased me for years about whether I was ready to read my letter, even as an adult, I’ve decided to write another one. Once more allowing myself to express my hopes, dreams, and wishes for this coming year, just as I did long ago. It’s a way to honor their memory and what they meant to me.</p>
<p>Dearest friends and kindred hearts,
A brand new year in silence starts.
Let hopes and dreams now rise and sing,
Like gentle birds who greet the spring.</p>
<p>May laughter bloom in common ground,
And gentle peace at last be found.
Where strife and fear once held their reign,
May healing light now ease our pain.</p>
<p>From crowded halls to quiet lands,
Let kindness guide our gentle hands.
With wars and worries cast aside,
May truth and mercy be our guide.</p>
<p>No cherished dream shall slip away,
As dawn reveals a brighter day.
With courage true and an open heart,
We’ll mend this world in every part.</p>
<p>Your hopeful voice when skies aren&rsquo;t clear,</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can always opt for the easy way out, as I did as an adult, and whenever they teased me, I would simply respond with:</p>
<p>Dearest godmother and father,
A gift is fine, but cash goes farther.</p>
