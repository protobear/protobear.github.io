  <p>Over the past decade, we’ve compiled a vault of the most &rsquo;legendary&rsquo; commentary r/MMORPG has received. Some gems have been lost to time, but here’s what survived the purge. And just a heads up, not every comment was personally aimed at me; some were crowd-sourced by fellow mods who graciously shared their own &lsquo;fan mail&rsquo; and funny comments they came across.</p>
<p>But I think this poster said it best.</p>
<p>⚠️Trigger Warning
I&rsquo;m not one to quickly write a trigger warning, but there&rsquo;s a lot of racism, homophobia, misogyny and calls for death and suicide to be found in here. Like a LOT.</p>
<p>Ah, my first hatemail! Like a rite of passage, this was the one that officially welcomed me into the glamorous world of internet moderation. Nothing says &lsquo;you&rsquo;re doing great&rsquo; like a well-constructed accusation of a &lsquo;personal vendetta&rsquo; and an &rsquo;emotionally unstable character.&rsquo; It’s almost poetic, really. They didn&rsquo;t care &lsquo;in the slightest,&rsquo; yet here we are, two paragraphs deep.</p>
<p>Rope must have been on sale in the unhinged section, because here we have two people independently deciding that’s the best way to make their point.</p>
<p>Nothing says &lsquo;I’m a well-adjusted human being&rsquo; like rebranding your revolting preferences with a new label. Truly, these are the shining gems of r/MMORPG.</p>
<p>Nothing says teamwork like moderators questioning each other’s taste… and basic survival skills.</p>
<p>The dedication to calling others &lsquo;faggot&rsquo; or &lsquo;gay&rsquo; here is… impressive? Maybe if they put this much effort into learning game mechanics, they’d finally be able to complete an LFR difficulty raid.</p>
<p>I truly hope you’ve found what you’re looking for. May your search be as boundless as your dedication to… custom character adjustments.</p>
<p>Mod chat: where professionalism goes to die, and banter reigns supreme.</p>
<p>Some rants are so gloriously unhinged that it actually pains us a little to remove them.</p>
<p>Sometimes ya&rsquo;ll are just plain weird</p>
<p>If you’re going to throw insults, just know: our mods have comebacks locked and loaded.</p>
<p>After all the rants, the roasts, and the ridiculousness, it’s nice to remember that there’s a little good in every community. We’re lucky to have moments like these.</p>
<p>The tool we use to moderate Reddit rewards us with this little picture of a cat when the report queue is finally empty. It’s like our prize for surviving the chaos.</p>
<p>So here it is, as a reward. Thanks for enduring it all with us!</p>
