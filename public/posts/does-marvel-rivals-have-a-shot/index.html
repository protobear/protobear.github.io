  <p>Marvel Rivals had an impressive first day with nearly 440,000 concurrent players on Steam. For a hero shooter venturing into Overwatch 2&rsquo;s territory, this is no small feat. Comparatively, Overwatch 2&rsquo;s Steam player count sits at a modest 75,000.It&rsquo;s worth noting that most Overwatch players remain on Battle.net, making a direct comparison tricky. The real question is whether Marvel Rivals has what it takes to sustain this momentum, or if it will be yet another failed attempt by NetEase to make a long term sustainable Marvel Game.</p>
<p>From the outset, Marvel Rivals feels like a game crafted to tap into Overwatch&rsquo;s disillusioned playerbase, picking up where Blizzard may have faltered. Visually, it shares similarities with Overwatch but carves out its own identity with a unique art style for its heroes, steering clear of MCU-inspired designs. This deliberate choice helps the game avoid the &ldquo;Discount Avengers&rdquo; stigma that plagued the ill-fated Marvel’s Avengers live service game. So far, this comparison hasn’t reared its head, and that’s a testament to Rivals’ presentation.</p>
<p>Marvel Rivals takes an interesting approach with third-person gameplay, which injects chaos into matches, making the battlefield genuinely hard to read at times. A move also most likely made to showcase cosmetics, why buy a skin if you&rsquo;re only looking at a characters&rsquo; hands. While polished overall, the gunplay lacks the satisfying punch Overwatch has and abilities in Rivals simply don’t deliver the same feedback, which could hinder its long-term appeal.</p>
<p>The roster also presents a challenge. Overwatch heroes were designed from scratch for gameplay, but Rivals must adapt existing superheroes into a competitive shooter format. This occasionally creates a mismatch between a character’s lore-based powers and their in-game abilities, reminiscent of issues faced by Marvel’s Avengers once again. Yet, in a game like Rivals, lore is secondary, players aren’t here for an intricate narrative. NetEase, the developer, likely isn’t allowed to make significant narrative decisions that could affect Marvel’s broader properties, keeping lore impact minimal.</p>
<p>The choice of NetEase as the developer might raise eyebrows. Known more for mobile games than PC or console titles, NetEase already held Marvel licenses, having developed Marvel Super War (a now-defunct MOBA) and Marvel Duel (a struggling card game). Their track record with Marvel games is mixed, and they have shown no hesitation in shuttering underperforming projects. That said, their involvement in a high-profile PC and console game like Rivals is unexpected, considering their most successful title might be Diablo Immortal which is co-developed with Blizzard and has since also enjoyed a PC release. Fun fact: NetEase recently made headlines with arrests of employees over alleged money launderin, an odd backdrop for the launch of a major title.</p>
<p>So, can they pull it off?</p>
<p>To succeed, Marvel Rivals must meaningfully improve over time. Here’s what works in its favor:</p>
<ul>
<li>Overwatch 2’s Struggles: Blizzard’s slow content drip and lack of exciting updates have frustrated players. Their attempt to revive interest with a &ldquo;Classic Mode&rdquo; feels uninspired, recycling rather than innovating.</li>
<li>Fair Monetization: Rivals’ free-to-play model avoids the dreaded FOMO associated with battle passes. Players can progress through the pass at their own pace, a refreshing approach.</li>
<li>Marvel’s Popularity: The franchise remains a cultural juggernaut, even in a climate of superhero fatigue.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, Rivals faces significant challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>Superhero Fatigue: The genre is oversaturated, and audience interest is waning. And might not be enough to differentiate from Overwatch either.</li>
<li>Live Service Burnout: 2024 saw a mass exodus from live service games, a trend likely to continue in 2025. The lack of FOMO monetization could help here but also means they&rsquo;re leaving short term money on the table.</li>
<li>Crowded Competition: Heavyweights like Apex Legends, Valorant, and yes, Overwatch dominate the market. While games like Fortnite are still breaking player records nearly 8 years after launch.</li>
<li>Gameplay: While fun in casual play, issues like slow XP gain and lackluster gunplay could become sticking points when a competitive scene has been established.</li>
</ul>
<p>While the launch numbers are promising, they’re just the beginning. For context, Path of Exile 2, which launched the same day, boasts even higher concurrent player counts despite not being free-to-play. Marvel Rivals will need more than its name to retain players. Without consistent updates and compelling reasons to return, even the most loyal fans will move on. We&rsquo;ll have to see in the coming weeks if they manage to retain what they have, but if I were to bet I&rsquo;d say it will become more niche as time goes on, eventually growing when it finds its footing.</p>
<p>The ultimate success of Marvel Rivals hinges on its post-launch support. If NetEase avoids major missteps and commits to iterative improvements, the game could carve out a niche as a fun, casual experience players revisit from time to time. However, dethroning Overwatch 2 outright seems unlikely unless Blizzard continues to falter and Rivals proves itself long term.</p>
<p>PS Bring back &ldquo;Marvel Heroes&rdquo;, you cowards.</p>
