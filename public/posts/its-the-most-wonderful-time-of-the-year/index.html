  <p>Merry Christmas and a happy &ldquo;Please, for the love of all that is good, let my family members read a single book this year so they might form a nuanced opinion on any subject this holiday season, I&rsquo;m begging&rdquo;</p>
<p>If there’s one thing I genuinely love about this time of year, it’s the festive events in MMORPGs. When I first started playing World of Warcraft back in September 2007, I had no idea in-game celebrations were a thing. I somehow missed the Halloween event, but stumbling upon Greatfather Winter in Ironforge was a revelation. My eyes were opened to the possibilities these games could bring, namely, An escape from my family.</p>
<p>Christmas to me is a vibe, not a relgious thing. As secular as you can get. I don&rsquo;t even associate it with relgion most times.</p>
<p>So because &rsquo;t is the season let&rsquo;s take a look at some of my favorite christmas celebrations in MMORPGs. Starting with my absolute favorite, Guild Wars 2.</p>
<p>Guild Wars 2</p>
<p>The soundtrack for Wintersday so so incredibly hard.</p>
<p>The Winter wonderland jumping puzzle is my favorite jumping puzzle. Bar none.</p>
<p>its challenging without being annoying like the clocktower.</p>
<p>its long enough that you feel a bit of relief when you&rsquo;re done, challenging enough that I don&rsquo;t do it mindlessly either. I need a couple of tries before its in my fingers. But once its in there, i can run that sucker blind. And I will do it over and over and over again until I&rsquo;m sick of it. Not for the loot, just because I love it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever done Tixx&rsquo;s infinirarium. Well, I remember doing it once. But that&rsquo;s so long ago I don&rsquo;t remember it either.</p>
<p>I played Guild Wars (1) as well, and tbh i don&rsquo;t remember wintersday there. But wikipedia is assuring me it has it.</p>
<p>Wait</p>
<p>(Googles some things)</p>
<p>oh my god.</p>
<p>Kamadan fully covered in snow. 10/10 Arena Net you&rsquo;ve done it again.</p>
<p>World of Warcraft</p>
<p>They let themself fall behind a bit in my opinion.</p>
<p>But the random christmas trees everywhere like here in Honor Hold just, idk, its charming in some way. For a brief moment of time the holiday spirit is even on a desolate barren planet. It&rsquo;s no Guild Wars 1 putting Kamadan in snow moment, but it has its charms.</p>
<p>Some are better done than others, and it made me wish that WoW had a season system.</p>
<p>But 12 year old Marnick, fucking ate this shit up.</p>
<p>Destiny 2</p>
<p>Bungie has some amazing artists, because their branding department is strong.</p>
<p>How the fuck do you make shooting guns feel like Christmas? Also the snowball event in years past was always fun.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy XIV</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really care about the in-game event itself. But I adore all the artwork around it.</p>
<p>It feels like a traditional Christmas.</p>
<p>Honestly their event theme slaps as well</p>
<p>They manage to make it really sound like I imagine to be a traditional christmas</p>
