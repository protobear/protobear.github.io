  <p>Hey! This site is pretty personal, so you’ll find stuff you care about and stuff you might not. Here’s the deal though—if you sign up, you’ll get maybe one or two (at most three) emails a year from me. And those emails will only be for the articles I’m really proud of and want to share with you. No spam, just the occasional update when it’s worth it. No pressure, and you can unsubscribe anytime, no hard feelings.</p>
<p>And in the small chance you&rsquo;d like to receive an email for every article I ever write there&rsquo;s an option for that too. I don&rsquo;t know why you&rsquo;d want that though.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t see the subscribe box it means you&rsquo;re already subscribed.</p>
