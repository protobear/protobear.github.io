<meta name="description" content="A few weeks ago, we got a message from an influencer marketing manager (whatever that is) representing Raid Shadow Legends. They wanted to collaborate with us to promote their upcoming Christmas event on r/MMORPG. The offer? Real-life prizes, in-game loot, and, of course, ✨compensation✨.
While the deal sounded tempting for about half a second, I couldn’t help but laugh at the sheer absurdity of Raid Shadow Legends pitching us. Have they really burned through all the actual influencers and landed on subreddits as their backup plan? I’ve always joked about their over-the-top sponsorships and, honestly, never held back my less-than-kind assumptions about the game itself. So, naturally, I declined. We’re not sellouts here and we’ve never accepted money or compensation for any kind of promotion, we’re not about to start now." />

  <p>A few weeks ago, we got a message from an influencer marketing manager (whatever that is) representing Raid Shadow Legends. They wanted to collaborate with us to promote their upcoming Christmas event on r/MMORPG. The offer? Real-life prizes, in-game loot, and, of course, ✨compensation✨.</p>
<p>While the deal sounded tempting for about half a second, I couldn’t help but laugh at the sheer absurdity of Raid Shadow Legends pitching us. Have they really burned through all the actual influencers and landed on subreddits as their backup plan? I’ve always joked about their over-the-top sponsorships and, honestly, never held back my less-than-kind assumptions about the game itself. So, naturally, I declined. We’re not sellouts here and we’ve never accepted money or compensation for any kind of promotion, we’re not about to start now.</p>
<p>But then, a thought crossed my mind. What if Raid Shadow Legends isn’t as bad as I’ve always assumed? What if the endless ads, flashy sponsorships, and meme-level marketing actually mask a decent game? My ex used to play it, and let’s face it, since he dated me, his taste must be impeccable. There was only one way to know for sure: I downloaded it.</p>
<p>So does the advertising hype match reality? Is it a pay-to-win nightmare? Or is there a surprisingly good game buried under all the gacha mechanics? Let&rsquo;s find out!</p>
<p>Initial impressions:</p>
<p>No its so bad, dont make me</p>
<p>Game Overview</p>

</li>
<li>How are the graphics?
<ul>
<li>Do the visuals truly match the &ldquo;console-quality graphics&rdquo; advertised?</li>

<li>Does it offer compelling gameplay that keeps you hooked?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is the story like?

<ul>
<li>Can free-to-play players compete meaningfully, or are they hopelessly outclassed by paying players?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What do you get for your money?
<ul>
<li>Are the packs and offers worth the cost, or are they overpriced for what you receive?</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Does it have a steep learning curve, or is it welcoming?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How engaging is the endgame?
<ul>
<li>Does the game have content that keeps players coming back, or does it fizzle out after a while?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How much grind is required?
<ul>
<li>Is progression tied to a ridiculous amount of grinding or time investment?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Community and Longevity</p>

</ul>
</li>
