  <p>One of my favorite writers, Gita Jackson, wrote an article for Aftermath (One of my favorite websites) titled &ldquo;For The Love of God, Make Your Own Website&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a good article, go read it.</p>
<p>So in doing my part of making the internet a better place, and also because I&rsquo;m an educator, I’m writing a series of articles about self-hosting your own website.  Why? Because for the internet to stay weird, interesting, and creative, people need the freedom to experiment, push boundaries, and discover limitations, all without being bogged down by ongoing costs or platform restrictions.</p>
<p>Let’s take this journey together. We’ll cover the essentials: how to get a server, set it up, build your website, acquire and configure your domain, and finally, serve your site to the world. Let’s reclaim a little bit of the internet’s magic.</p>

<p>So, You Want to Build a Website?</p>
<p>There are countless reasons to build your own website: maybe you want to start a blog, create a fansite for something you love, set up a page for your band, or host something completely random—like a live feed of your Christmas tree or reviews of Hercule Poirot episodes. The beauty of the internet lies in its limitless possibilities.</p>
<p>At its core, creating a website boils down to three key elements:</p>
<ol>
<li>An internet connection</li>
<li>A place to host your site</li>
<li>A domain name so others can easily find it</li>
</ol>
<p>Before diving in, it&rsquo;s important to define what kind of site you want to build. This decision will guide your choices later. There are generally two paths:</p>
<ul>
<li>A CMS (Content Management System): Perfect for easily adding posts and pages with minimal hassle. For when you want to create something like a blog using Wordpress, Ghost or something more static like Jekyll.</li>
<li>Code it yourself: Offers maximum creative freedom but may require you to learn new skills, like coding or design. But for a website that doesn&rsquo;t really get regular structured updates it could be the right choice. And it allows you to do some cool things.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both approaches are valid. One offers convenience, the other offers flexibility. For instance, the blog you’re reading now runs on a platform called Ghost, which I find easy to use and well-suited for my needs. On the other hand, my links page was built from scratch. It’s a quirky little site that looks like what I call &ldquo;OS X(P),&rdquo; and the process of creating it was just plain fun. You don’t even have to choose, your server can host multiple sites and services simultaneously.</p>
<p>Learning the skills to build a website, whether from scratch or using a platform, is empowering. It gives you control over your content and eliminates reliance on social media algorithms. Plus, owning your platform means you decide how it looks, functions, and grows.</p>
<p>So, with a bit of patience and curiosity, you too can create your own corner of the internet. Why not get started today?</p>
<p>Understanding the Parts of a Website</p>
<p>Websites are made up of several components that work together to deliver content to users. You don’t need to be an expert in all of them, but having a basic understanding will help you make informed decisions and troubleshoot issues when needed. Let’s break it down:</p>
<p>The fact you have the power to do any and all of this is what makes the internet an amazing place.</p>
<p>Ultimately all we need for you to have a website is</p>
<p>An internet connection</p>
<p>A place to host the website</p>
<p>A domain name so people can visit it easily</p>
<p>But in order to get started you do need to ask yourself what it is you want to build. Because it will help you make choice down the line. But ultimately there&rsquo;s two paths to take, either something in a blog format or something completely unique.</p>
<p>A blog requires you to easily make new posts, add posts and pages without much trouble. But you can also create your own pages from scratch. Allowing you much more freedom to create whatever you want, but that also will require you to learn some new skills if you don&rsquo;t already have them.</p>
<p>Either option is valid, one gives more freedom to do what you want, the other is more user friendly but limited to whatever the platforms allow you to do.</p>
<p>The blog you&rsquo;re reading this on is running on a platform called &ldquo;Ghost&rdquo; it works well, and for what I use it I&rsquo;m overall happy with it. But another site I&rsquo;ve made namely <a href="https://links.protobear.dev">https://links.protobear.dev</a> was made from scratch, its a silly site to host my links that looks like what I call &ldquo;OS X(P)&rdquo;, and its fun to make stuff like that. You also don&rsquo;t need to choose, both are possible. While it doesn&rsquo;t run on the same server, it could. I run more than one service on it.</p>
<p>Ultimately learning these things can only help you, knowledge has never hurt anyone you can be smug and feel better than others. But we&rsquo;re not doing this from a perspective of self-improvement, but rather as a way to own your platform and content without having to rely on social media algorithms.</p>
<p>So with a little perseverance you too can have your own website,</p>
<p>Getting a Server</p>
<p>Your website needs a place to live. Which means we need a computer that serves you content, a webserver if you will.Ni</p>
<p>Ultimately a webserver is nothing special, just a computer that runs 24/7. It doesn&rsquo;t need a monitor, keyboard or mouse attached. All it needs is power and ethernet.</p>
<p>If you have a computer that works, is gathering dust, has been made after 2010 and has at least 8GB of RAM you don&rsquo;t need to make an investment. But I&rsquo;m going to recommend you do anyway unless you have solar energy or if you&rsquo;re still not certain because running a computer 24/7 costs money.</p>
<p>And the more powerhungry it is, the most it&rsquo;ll cost and in the year of our lord Linus Torvalds 2024 we have some really power efficient machines that run great.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to recommend you get a Raspberry pi 5, 8GB. It&rsquo;s small, its efficient, it looks intimidating I know but just don&rsquo;t be a lil bitch about it. You want a website? You want to be Marx&rsquo; favorite anarchist? Let&rsquo;s go. They&rsquo;re available for around 80 bucks standalone. But if you&rsquo;re like totally new to this get the the full set for about 130 usd. I GET THAT ITS EXPENSIVE! BUT ITS ALSO LIKE A FULL ON COMPUTER. It is a capable machine.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to assume you just bought a Raspberry PI and set it up for this.</p>
