<meta name="description" content="In a previous article, I argued that an MMORPG can mean different things to different people. it’s a genre defined as much by the players as the developers.

For me, an MMORPG has always been about relationships, shared experiences, and collaborative storytelling in a virtual world we collectively inhabit. Capturing that magic is challenging enough on a powerful PC—the idea of translating it to mobile feels nearly impossible. Spotty connections, limited battery life, and hardware constraints that make rendering multiple players a technical nightmare only underscore the complexity." />

  <p>In a previous article, I argued that an MMORPG can mean different things to different people. it’s a genre defined as much by the players as the developers. It&rsquo;s a conversation, a constantly evolving relationship between the two. That’s no easy feat when there’s one developer and countless players, each with their own ideas of what the experience should be. Some of those players want that experience on mobile.</p>
<p>For me, an MMORPG has always been about relationships, shared experiences, and collaborative storytelling in a virtual world we collectively inhabit. Capturing that magic is challenging enough on a powerful PC—the idea of translating it to mobile feels nearly impossible. Spotty connections, limited battery life, and hardware constraints that make rendering multiple players a technical nightmare only underscore the complexity.</p>
<p>So when a fellow moderator from r/MMORPG raised mobile MMORPGs during a recent Bluesky discussion, it sparked a question that&rsquo;s been simmering in the back of my mind: What would I even want from a mobile MMORPG?</p>
<p>I ended up trying the game and my first thought was &ldquo;Man, this feels like it was developed on a PC, to be tested on a PC&rdquo; With interactables only being interactable through a button and not by pressing the person or the thing. While also very much feeling the limits of being designed for mobile , with no real exploration to speak of and very linear boxed in zones.</p>
<p>So it was an MMORPG boiled down to what could work on mobile. And not really an MMORPG built for mobile. Honestly, I&rsquo;d play it again if I had to wait 20 minutes for something.</p>
<p>That conversation really got me thinking, what would a game have to do to be picked over anything else on my phone? Now I&rsquo;m not really someone that plays mobile games with the exception of Animal Crossing Pocket Camp because I&rsquo;m just built different. I also enjoyed Lego Star Wars Castaways but mostly I&rsquo;m into very short session games SP!NG and Ridiculous Fishing.</p>
<p>None of that really screams &ldquo;MMORPG&rdquo; right? But its how I use my phone, and its most likely why nobody is designing games that I like on there because I don&rsquo;t offer them the engagement they&rsquo;re looking for. Also I&rsquo;m broke as shit.</p>
<p>But I thought it&rsquo;d be fun to attempt and write something about what I&rsquo;d expect from a mobile MMORPG. And I have two things I&rsquo;d primarily want.</p>
<ol>
<li>An extension to an existing game</li>
<li>A game built around limited gameplay sessions</li>
</ol>
<p>So the first one would be &ldquo;simple&rdquo; but also not really economically feasible. I&rsquo;d kinda like it if these games would allow you to an extent to perform actions as your own character in an mmo you play. Let&rsquo;s take Guild Wars 2. What if the game shared my character roster. Could be a separate progression system but with some cross-play rewards. The idea that you&rsquo;re building out your main character in a mobile game when you can&rsquo;t play your main game is appealing.</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t happen because it could mean the following</p>
<ol>
<li>You&rsquo;re limiting your audience to the audience you already have</li>
<li>You&rsquo;re providing an experience that could be less rewarding if you&rsquo;re not playing the main game</li>
<li>If the mobile game does poorly you&rsquo;re now hurting the main game&rsquo;s reputation.</li>
</ol>
<p>None of these can&rsquo;t be overcome but they&rsquo;re hard. And I think that would be the gateway for me to be invested in a game. I had the WoW app on my phone, and I did the missions through it. But that wasn&rsquo;t really a game and more of an interface.</p>
<p>But what I really want is something Groo already touches on with &ldquo;Auto-play&rdquo;. &ldquo;Travel and combat gets old after a few minutes&rdquo; stating he likes models where he can take over the combat whenever. The Pokemon TCG is like that as well but I think that&rsquo;s the wrong approach.</p>
<p>Why build a game thats meant to be played by itself because its not interesting to do all the labor of leveling up, doing combat?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just build a game that&rsquo;s only the interesting parts? A game that asks you &ldquo;To play you need 10 minutes, if you want to continue we ask for another 10 minutes&rdquo; and so on, not something completely open ended. You&rsquo;re not going to be idling in Stormwind on mobile. There&rsquo;s nothing to be gained, typing and chatting in that world won&rsquo;t be better than me opening Discord and doing it there.</p>
<p>So I think what I&rsquo;d want is a game where I just run dungeons. Remove the overworld, remove the towns to run around in. Just keep the content you can pour into defined sessions, make it engaging and I&rsquo;d play it.</p>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
