  <p>Week 1: Went pretty well, for some reason the first two running sections are like physically hard and the others are hard because im out of shape.</p>
<p>Week 2: Longer running, went really well. I was a bit scared extending every running section by a third was going to be too much. But I actually ended up walking away thinking extending the walking sections with 30 seconds ended up being the thing that was too much.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also just not as dead afterwards. I came home and I felt overall fine, and now after my shower I don&rsquo;t really feel like I just went for a run.</p>
