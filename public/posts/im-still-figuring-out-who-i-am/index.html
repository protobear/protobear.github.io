  <p>I don&rsquo;t know who I wrote this for. Maybe it&rsquo;s for me, maybe it&rsquo;s for someone else who finds it and wants to understand me better. It&rsquo;s deeply personal, and I questioned many times whether I wanted to share it. But here it is, raw and honest.</p>
<p>Before We Begin</p>

<p>This second point often gets forgotten when we look back on past choices, and it gives us a distorted perspective, as if everything should have been obvious. The truth is, it wasn’t. And chiding yourself for not knowing then what you know now is pointless, unless you’re trying to learn from it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to look back and judge ourselves harshly, but we shouldn&rsquo;t. Back then, we all did the best we could with what we knew.</p>
<p>Embracing the Process of Becoming</p>
<p>I don’t have all the answers, and I’m still figuring out who I am. This article reflects where I’m at today, a person navigating the process of self-discovery. Some of the things you’ll read are struggles I’ve unpacked and dealt with, while others are still a work in progress. I also know I make mistakes, and I might come across as if I’m shifting the blame, but that’s not my intention.</p>
<p>It’s been a long road, and this isn’t the full story. There are parts I’m too insecure to share and traumas I’m not ready to unpack. Still, I hope this gives an honest glimpse into my journey, the ups and downs, the growth, and everything in between.</p>
<p>Whether you’re a friend, family member, acquaintance, or just someone passing by, I hope something here resonates with you. Maybe you’ll realize you’re not alone in your thoughts or feelings. Or maybe you’ll think I’m absolutely batshit crazy and know to run the other way if you see me.</p>
<p>That said, if this sparks any thoughts or experiences you want to share, I’d love to hear from you. Feel free to send me an send me an email.</p>
<p>Finding my way after falling behind</p>
<p>For a long time, I had no idea what to do with my life. After a fight with my dad, I left home, fell into depression, and started working as a writer. Later, I moved back in with my mom and tried to get my life on track by pursuing higher education. But even after passing entrance exams, I flunked out. It wasn’t a dramatic failure, more of a quiet fizzle. I slowly realized I might not be cut out for this.</p>
<p>I used a job offer from a game studio in London as an excuse to drop school entirely, hoping it was my escape. It wasn’t. But that is a story for another time.</p>
<p>Flunking out stayed with me, making me feel like I wasn’t smart enough. Looking back, it was a combination of unmanaged ADHD, not being ready, and an unsupportive environment. My stepdad refused to get internet, so I had to study at my grandparents’ house after they got it installed for me. Before this, I spent money on prepaid 4G cards just to submit my homework. I kept all of this to myself because I didn’t want to be a burden.</p>
<p>Eventually, I decided to go back to school, but I felt insecure and terrified of failing again. My dad was angry, telling me not to waste time, and my aunt believed I had run out of chances. But a guy I was seeing at the time, Kenneth, inspired me by going back to school himself. So, I pushed forward.</p>
<p>That decision required me to stand firm in who I wanted to be because so many people around me were trying to dissuade me from even trying. I’ve always been stubborn, and it felt like I had to summon all my strength to carve out a new path. When I hit a roadblock in the second semester, I panicked, thinking history was repeating itself. But this time, I didn’t give up.</p>
<p>Living with the feeling I&rsquo;m faking it</p>
<p>Starting a new job means realizing how much you don’t know. It was a significant shift, moving from the comfort of academia to the demands of a real-world environment, and I found myself questioning if I could keep up. When I began my internship as a software developer at a bank, I learned more in that semester than in the five prior ones combined. But it was mismanaged. My mentor struggled to explain things, and his coding style clashed with the rest of the team. Progress was slow, and even after graduating, I had little oversight. With the team mostly on holiday, I was left to build a mortgage repayment system on my own.</p>
<p>The pressure mounted as I struggled to meet expectations. I felt overwhelmed by the workload and the lack of guidance, which made every mistake feel like a personal failure. I made mistakes, hid my struggles, and asked fewer questions to avoid looking incompetent. Working from home made it easy to conceal the paralysis I felt. Over time, my confidence eroded.</p>
<p>About a month before my gastric sleeve surgery, I hit a breaking point from the mounting stress, and mentally collapsed. I kept telling myself, &lsquo;If you make it to the surgery date, you&rsquo;ll finally get a break,&rsquo; but I just couldn&rsquo;t hold out that long. The sound of a Teams notification would send me into a panic. After two months off, I returned to work and sent my mentor an email explaining what went wrong and what needed to change. His response? A blunt dismissal of my abilities. The next day, I resigned.</p>
<p>Writing this might seem risky, but the rest of my story proves otherwise. Former colleagues reached out, validating my feelings and blaming the mentor’s poor guidance, something that they also brought up while I worked there. Still, that lingering voice of doubt whispers that maybe I wasn’t good enough. Maybe if I had been better, things would’ve been different.</p>
<p>After resigning, I felt lost, but found a new sense of purpose in teaching. Teaching has been a lifeline for my mental health. I’ve found confidence in it, but the self-imposed pressure is intense. Every class needs to be perfect; every PowerPoint must be flawless. Even with praise from students and colleagues, any dip in quality feels like failure. It feels like I’ll be exposed as a fraud.</p>
<p>I’m proud of the work I’ve done, but I still wrestle with inadequacy. I didn’t know how to teach at first, and I’m still learning as I go. Maybe it’s “fake it till you make it,” but it’s a start.</p>
<p>Romance, Friendships, and the distance I keep</p>
<p>My insecurity and anxiety don’t clock out when I finish work, they affect how I connect with others.</p>
<p>It’s hard for me to believe someone might genuinely like me, whether romantically or platonically. Growing up, I often felt like love or affection had to be earned through achievements, and that belief still influences my relationships today. When someone comes on strong, I get overwhelmed. But when I like someone, I feel like I have to prove myself, which leads to overextending. I burn myself out, worry I’m too much, and then retreat when I feel exposed. It’s a cycle of pushing too hard and pulling away.</p>
<p>There’s always that voice in my head saying, “Nobody likes you.” It convinces me that people only tolerate me for what they can get. I’ve worked hard to let go of that mindset, but I’m not there yet. I’m slowly learning not to come on so strong.</p>
<p>Listening to Jacotte Brokken’s podcast about bullying, &ldquo;Niemand vindt u leuk,&rdquo; hit home. Every story felt painfully familiar. It made me realize how often I push people away out of fear, thinking no one cares whether I’m there or not.</p>
<p>One memory I’ve never shared is an email I received at 12 from my only friend at the time, Leander. We were at the same boarding school in Bruges, and he told me he couldn’t be my friend anymore because he was afraid of being bullied as well. I read that email in the school library, trying not to cry, trying not to disturb the silence that enveloped the room. That experience shaped how I approach friendships today. I keep people at arm’s length, afraid of facing that kind of rejection again.</p>
<p>My Body: A work in progress</p>
<p>I’ve been skinny, fat, then skinny again, only to end up fat once more. In early 2024, I had gastric sleeve surgery. I’m still fat, just less so now. How you see your body changes how you act, often without realizing it.</p>
<p>For every kilo I’ve lost, my confidence has grown, but it’s fragile. I’ve been here before. When I was 16, I lost a lot of weight and realized something: people treat you better when you’re thinner. They take you more seriously, are kinder, and suddenly you’re invited to more things. Part of it is probably how I carry myself, but it comes from both sides.</p>
<p>Still, I think I hide my struggles well. I’m prone to bingeing, though now it’s less food than before. I can’t keep cookies or candy at home, but it’s mostly an issue when I’m alone. When I’m with friends or working, I have more control.</p>
<p>So, if you see me eating a protein bar while everyone else is drinking, it’s because I need to eat, not because I’m having a moment.</p>
<p>Some days, I look in the mirror and think, “Damn, I look skinny,” and a few hours later, it’s “God, I’m fat.” Both thoughts can happen in the same day. It’s strange. I feel more confident, but sometimes it feels fake. It clashes with how I’ve always thought of myself. Maybe as a defense mechanism, I’ve focused on impressing people with what I say and do rather than how I look. That’s why my hair’s often a mess, and if I could wear sweatpants to work every day, I would.</p>
<p>But now, I care about how I look. It matters to me. I’ll feel good until I interact with people, and then the insecurity creeps back in. It’s another area where I feel the need to overperform, and honestly, it’s exhausting.</p>
<p>Why Rejection Still Feels So Personal to Me</p>
<p>Rejection has always hit me harder than it should. Growing up, my parents tried their best, but I often felt like an inconvenience. They worked long hours, and I was often left with a babysitter. When they divorced, the instability continued, my mom’s relationships were rocky, and the sense of a steady family life never really materialized. I wasn’t invited to birthdays, and after kindergarten, I don&rsquo;t remember having a birthday party of my own. All of this made me feel like I didn&rsquo;t really belong anywhere.</p>
<p>This led to a deep-seated need for clarity. My dad&rsquo;s expectations were not only demanding but also confusing, and this often put me in situations where I&rsquo;d be criticized despite genuinely trying. There was a lot of gaslighting, like when he denied not letting me go to the doctor for weeks, even though I remember it vividly. These moments left me struggling to trust my own perception of events, which made me seek validation from others. I find it nearly impossible to tell if someone likes me just from their actions; I need them to say it outright. It might come off as needy, but it’s more about reassuring myself that I’m not misreading things.</p>
<p>The only time I remember feeling truly loved or accepted growing up was when I overachieved. I started to believe that affection was conditional, that it had to be earned. Even now, I rarely trust compliments or praise. At a recent post-op checkup, the doctor told me I&rsquo;d done exceptionally well by losing a third of my body weight. But when the nurse congratulated me, I just couldn&rsquo;t accept it. I figured they must say that to everyone to make them not lose their confidence.</p>
<p>If you tell me I’ve done a good job and I feel like I prompted you, even just a little, I won&rsquo;t believe you. I’ll assume you&rsquo;re just trying to be nice or telling me what I want to hear. This is a mindset I’m trying to break, but it’s deeply ingrained and hard to shake. I want to believe I’m enough, that I don’t need external validation, but most days, it’s still a struggle.</p>
<p>Loneliness and the Masks I Wear</p>
<p>Growing up, I often felt like I was in the way. From the age of seven, I spent most of my time in my room. I’d watch some TV, but as soon as my stepdad got home, I’d retreat. I wasn’t welcome downstairs when he was around. My mom should have made it clear we were a package deal, but I still don’t blame him entirely.</p>
<p>That isolation became comfortable. I love being alone, not having to worry about how I’m affecting others, whether I’m too loud, too messy, or taking up too much space because I&rsquo;m fat. I shouldn’t have to feel like a burden for existing, but sometimes I do. Especially in the moments where my ADHD is just making it hard for me to manage just being me.</p>
<p>As much as I enjoy solitude, I need connection. I love going out, but I often find myself observing rather than participating. When I was 17, I worked at a youth house tending bar. It was a way to be social while keeping people at arm’s length. I told myself their rejection didn’t matter because I was just there to pour drinks. (Even though I was there for them too.)</p>
<p>Social media helped me bridge that gap. It allowed me to connect at my own pace, on my terms. But with it comes the pressure to present an idealized version of yourself. I try to avoid that trap, balancing authenticity with sharing things people want to engage with. If I only posted stuff like this, it’d probably bum everyone out.</p>
<p>In the past few months, I’ve made progress. I’ve reconnected with old friends and made some new ones. But I’m still scared of coming on too strong or misreading others’ intentions. It’s a work in progress. But I&rsquo;m happy I&rsquo;m an active participant now as opposed to standing at the sidelines.</p>
<p>I’m starting to let go of the masks I wear in social settings and just be myself. And if that bothers people, I’m sorry. I’m still figuring out who I am, and you’re witnessing that process in real time.</p>
<p>Embracing the Uncertainty</p>
<p>So, that’s where I stand in understanding myself right now. Is it all accurate? I don’t know, and that’s okay. Life isn’t about having all the answers; it’s about growing and adapting. I’m learning to accept that stability and happiness are things you work toward, they’re a journey, not a destination.</p>
<p>Writing this was hard. I didn’t even set out to write it. I was just messing with a pen and suddenly had two handwritten pages. But through this process, I’ve realized I’m someone who fights for myself, who values connection, and who’s working hard to embrace both my strengths and flaws. Still, as I write this, a wave of insecurity hits me. What will people think? Will they assume this is how I feel all the time? Will they think certain parts are about them? And maybe the biggest fear: Will this somehow affect the friendships I’ve recently made?</p>
<p>To myself, I say: embrace the uncertainty. Accept the future for what it is and let it unfold.</p>
