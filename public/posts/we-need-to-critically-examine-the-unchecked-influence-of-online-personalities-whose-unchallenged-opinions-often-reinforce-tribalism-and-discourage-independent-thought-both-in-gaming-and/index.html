  <p>Why do we put so much weight on what big personalities like Asmongold think about games—or anything, for that matter? His opinions often feel surface-level and reactionary, yet people consume them as if they’re gospel. This isn’t unique to him; it’s part of a broader culture that elevates influencers and streamers to near-deity status, regardless of their track records or the substance of their commentary. He’s said inflammatory things—like calling Palestinians an “inferior culture”—and still gets celebrated. He’s dismissed a woman’s award win as a “diversity pick,” perpetuating harmful narratives. Yet his fanbase shrugs it off or worse, rallies to his defense.</p>
<p>This isn’t to say people like Asmongold are irredeemable or uniquely terrible. Everyone says dumb things, and some grace should be extended to public figures who inevitably slip up. But there are limits. The bigger problem isn’t just what these figures say—it’s the uncritical fanboyism and tribalism that props them up.</p>
<p>It’s not just about gaming. We see the same problem in politics and ideology, where people isolate themselves in bubbles and let influencers do the thinking for them. Whether it’s liberal YouTubers or reactionary streamers, these bubbles skew perspectives and make people more reactive, less critical. Instead of engaging meaningfully—reading, playing games, forming independent opinions—we default to pre-packaged takes. If someone says a game is “woke garbage,” why not play it and see for yourself? If someone says something offensive, don’t just cheer or cancel them—think critically about why they said it and what it means.</p>
<p>To craft a meaningful article, you’ll want to build a compelling case that resonates with your audience and offers fresh insights. Here&rsquo;s a step-by-step guide to make your article thoughtful and impactful:</p>
<ol>
<li>Define Your Core Argument</li>
</ol>
<p>Your thesis statement should guide every part of the article. Restate it clearly:</p>
<p>“Uncritical fanboyism of online personalities fosters tribalism and discourages independent thought, stifling meaningful discourse in gaming and beyond.”</p>
<p>This keeps your article focused.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Research and Context</li>
</ol>
<p>Ground your argument in examples and evidence:</p>
<ul>
<li>Case Studies:
<ul>
<li>Look at specific instances where influencers like Asmongold (or others) sparked controversy, examining their comments and the reaction. For example:
<ul>
<li>Asmongold’s remarks on Palestinians or his reaction to awards.</li>
<li>Other influencers who were similarly uncritically celebrated despite controversy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Historical/Trend Analysis:
<ul>
<li>How has the role of influencers evolved in gaming culture? Compare older gaming journalism (e.g., magazines like PC Gamer) with the rise of influencers as tastemakers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Broader Cultural Examples:
<ul>
<li>Highlight parallels in politics, where ideological bubbles shape discourse (e.g., liberal YouTubers, conservative streamers).</li>
<li>Use studies or statistics on social media echo chambers to contextualize the problem of insular thinking.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Impact of Tribalism:
<ul>
<li>Research how &ldquo;us vs. them&rdquo; mentalities develop in fanbases.</li>
<li>Look into psychological studies on parasocial relationships, which explain why people defend their favorite personalities irrationally.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>Structure Your Article</li>
</ol>
<p>Break your article into digestible sections:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Introduction:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hook readers with a provocative opening about Asmongold or another influencer. Use a controversial example to draw attention.</li>
<li>State your thesis clearly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Rise of Influencers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explore how influencers became central to gaming culture. Discuss how their opinions shape trends, create bubbles, and displace other sources of critical thought (e.g., gaming journalism).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Problem with Fanboyism:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dive into examples of uncritical support, from Asmongold to others, to show how it stifles meaningful conversations.</li>
<li>Contrast fanboyism with constructive discourse or thoughtful critique.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Broader Impact:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expand to other areas, like politics, to show this isn’t just a “gamer” issue but a societal one. How does this tribalism limit people’s worldviews?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Call for Critical Thinking:</p>
<ul>
<li>Propose solutions:
<ul>
<li>Encourage readers to engage critically with content.</li>
<li>Suggest practices like playing games themselves or diversifying the voices they follow online.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conclusion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tie it all together by revisiting your thesis and challenging readers to rethink their relationship with influencers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tone and Voice</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Keep it conversational and engaging to appeal to gamers and readers of online commentary.</li>
<li>Use humor or sarcasm sparingly to critique fanboyism without alienating your audience.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li>Include Personal Reflections</li>
</ol>
<p>Make your argument relatable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share your own experience with influencers or how your views have been shaped by them.</li>
<li>Reflect on when you realized the importance of stepping outside ideological bubbles.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="6">
<li>What to Write About</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The Psychology of Fanboyism:
<ul>
<li>Why do people rally behind personalities like Asmongold even when they say something indefensible?</li>
<li>Explore parasocial relationships and the tribal need for &ldquo;leaders.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gaming Journalism vs. Influencers:
<ul>
<li>Compare and contrast these two sources of opinions. Why is one trusted more than the other?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Danger of Oversimplification:
<ul>
<li>Discuss how soundbites and reactionary content oversimplify nuanced issues like politics, diversity, and creativity in gaming.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Solutions:
<ul>
<li>Offer tangible steps readers can take, like diversifying their media diet, playing games before forming opinions, or engaging with people outside their bubbles.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="7">
<li>Balance and Nuance</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Avoid painting influencers as purely bad; acknowledge their role in making gaming accessible and exciting for many.</li>
<li>Recognize that tribalism and bubbles are human tendencies but argue for pushing against them.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="8">
<li>Support with Sources</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Studies on parasocial relationships or tribalism in media.</li>
<li>Examples of past controversies in gaming.</li>
<li>Thoughtful articles on influencer culture.</li>
<li>Stats on social media echo chambers and their effects.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="9">
<li>Checklist for Impact</li>
</ol>
<p>Before publishing, ensure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clarity: Does the article have a clear argument?</li>
<li>Balance: Have you avoided extreme takes that might alienate readers?</li>
<li>Call to Action: Does it inspire readers to think critically or change their habits?</li>
<li>Originality: Are you adding new insights to a well-trodden topic?</li>
</ul>
<p>By focusing on these steps, you’ll create an article that challenges your audience and contributes meaningfully to the discourse about gaming, influencers, and fan culture.</p>
