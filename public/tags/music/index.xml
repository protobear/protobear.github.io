      <description>&lt;p&gt;Closing Time&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Originally, I was going to pick a thrash metal album for this article, but a sleepless night due to the sweltering heat left me craving something that would mellow me the fuck out. So, I ventured into a genre I wasn’t very familiar with: blues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Eventually stumbling onto “Closing Time” by Tom Waits I sat down to start to listen while watching the sun rise. Which perfectly accompanied the opening track “Ol’55”, which sounded exactly like what I needed. Its melancholic yet sweet melody, paired with relatable lyrics about driving home after a one-night stand as the sun rises, evoked a sweet sounding nostalgia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Originally, I was going to pick a thrash metal album for this article, but a sleepless night due to the sweltering heat left me craving something that would mellow me the fuck out. So, I ventured into a genre I wasn’t very familiar with: blues.</p>
<p>Eventually stumbling onto “Closing Time” by Tom Waits I sat down to start to listen while watching the sun rise. Which perfectly accompanied the opening track “Ol’55”, which sounded exactly like what I needed. Its melancholic yet sweet melody, paired with relatable lyrics about driving home after a one-night stand as the sun rises, evoked a sweet sounding nostalgia.</p>
<p>The album features music that might not get stuck in your head but is made to be thoroughly enjoyable in the moment. The lyrics weave narratives without being overly complicated, a refreshing change from yesterday’s trip with MGMT. Maybe it’s the sleep deprivation making me more open to actually feeling something, but the album effectively evokes the emotions Tom sings about. Albeit those emotions primarily being “somber” and “serene” but in a way that can uncloud you from intensely negative sentiment. Not all songs fit this mold; for instance, “Lonely” is literally about being lonely, with 27% of the lyrics consisting of the word “lonely.” However, even here this track doesn’t convey an overwhelming sadness but rather a low, persistent melancholy. Am I reading too much into it? Possibly. But then “Ice Cream Man” comes along, a more upbeat song about seduction, or so I assume. It’s a bit quirky.</p>
<p>Overall, Tom Waits’ “Closing Time” is a fantastic album filled with emotionally driven songs about life, desire, love, and loss. It’s impressive how the album balances depth with a sense of not taking itself too seriously, both lyrically and musically.</p>

      <title>MGMT, Oracular Spectacular</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Oracular Spectacular&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I often wonder how creative projects like this come together. Was there a grand vision, or did things naturally evolve into the final product? This question lingers especially when considering the choice to open the album with “Time to Pretend.” The song cynically mocks the clichés of rockstar success, suggesting that even in our dream scenarios, reality still hits hard. At least, that’s my interpretation. Unlike Rage Against the Machine, which delivers its messages very directly, or Marian Hill, which seems to lack message, MGMT layers their songs with meaning and metaphor.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>I often wonder how creative projects like this come together. Was there a grand vision, or did things naturally evolve into the final product? This question lingers especially when considering the choice to open the album with “Time to Pretend.” The song cynically mocks the clichés of rockstar success, suggesting that even in our dream scenarios, reality still hits hard. At least, that’s my interpretation. Unlike Rage Against the Machine, which delivers its messages very directly, or Marian Hill, which seems to lack message, MGMT layers their songs with meaning and metaphor.</p>
<p>“Weekend Wars” is open to multiple interpretations. Is it about the fleeting nature of weekends? A quest for self-discovery? I’m not entirely sure, but that’s part of the charm. “The Youth” feels like a call to break generational cycles, while “Electric Feel” could be about the thrill of a new attraction, sex, or even the effects of drugs. MGMT leaves these interpretations open. This interpretative aspect acts almost like a Rorschach test, revealing as much about the listener as the music itself. For example, “Kids” seems to explore how we are shaped, often negatively, by the actions of those around us. But other people might say its about life, and how it’s fleeting so its better to not be passive in your observation of it.</p>
<p>A criticism I had with my previous reviews, particularly with Marian Hill, is that not all songs manage to have their own identity. This is not the case with MGMT’s debut album. Every song on “Oracular Spectacular” stands on its own, each with a unique character. While some tracks may be more memorable than others, there are no bad songs on the album — a hill I’m willing to die on. If I have to say something negative its that some songs might feel a bit too long. But given the trend of shortening tracks in order to appeal to for short-form video content virality, I’d rather have a song that perhaps overstays its welcome than one that doesn’t have enough time to develop.</p>
<p>“Oracular Spectacular” is a true gift. Its expertly crafted, sometimes psychedelic synthesizer sounds, paired with robust vocals and often impenetrable lyrics, create a 40-minute journey that captivates from start to finish.</p>

      <title>Marian Hill, Act One</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Act One&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Marian Hill is a duo I was familiar with primarily because of the song “Down,” which opens this album. “Down” is a standout track with its catchy chopped vocals and trap beat, and it’s no surprise it’s a favourite of mine on Apple Music.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I continued through the album, I was initially concerned that the rest of the tracks might not match the high bar set by “Down.” However, “Talk to Me” quickly eased that worry with its intriguing saxophone sounds, setting a promising tone for the album that it ultimately could not entirely maintain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Marian Hill is a duo I was familiar with primarily because of the song “Down,” which opens this album. “Down” is a standout track with its catchy chopped vocals and trap beat, and it’s no surprise it’s a favourite of mine on Apple Music.</p>
<p>As I continued through the album, I was initially concerned that the rest of the tracks might not match the high bar set by “Down.” However, “Talk to Me” quickly eased that worry with its intriguing saxophone sounds, setting a promising tone for the album that it ultimately could not entirely maintain.</p>
<p>Rather than focusing on lyrical depth, the album places its emphasis on creating a mood and incorporating unique sounds into each song. For example, “I Know Why” features a distinctive waterdrop effect. However, some tracks take a while to find their groove, and by the time they do, they’re nearly over. “Good” is a prime example, leaving you wanting more just as it hits its stride.</p>
<p>The vocals often serve as another instrument, blending seamlessly with the music, making it clear that the focus is more on the atmosphere than the lyrics themselves. Occasionally, though, the lyrics and music feel out of sync, as if they were crafted separately without fully meshing. This can range from mildly annoying to quite distracting, possibly due to a mixing issue.</p>
<p>The album maintains a laid-back yet engaging mood with a slightly dark edge. Marian Hill clearly aims to entertain, guiding listeners through various musical ideas. The experience somewhat dampened by weak vocal performance. Overall, “Act One” opens strong, falters somewhat in the middle, but manages to close on a high note. Highlights include “Down,” “Take Your Time,” “I Want You,” and “Mistaken.”</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Album: Rage Against The Machine&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’m not a fan of eponymous album names. Having to write “Rage Against the Machine” twice in a row—and needing to clarify that it wasn’t a mistake with the “Album:” prefix—only adds to my dislike. The fact that they technically have two eponymous albums doesn’t change my opinion. I’ll always be a hater at heart. But this might not be such a big issue for this album because Rage Against the Machine is a justifiably angry album.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>I’m not a fan of eponymous album names. Having to write “Rage Against the Machine” twice in a row—and needing to clarify that it wasn’t a mistake with the “Album:” prefix—only adds to my dislike. The fact that they technically have two eponymous albums doesn’t change my opinion. I’ll always be a hater at heart. But this might not be such a big issue for this album because Rage Against the Machine is a justifiably angry album.</p>
<p>Rage Against The Machine’s Rage Against the Machine should be an extremely contemporary album that points a finger at the issues the band identified at the time. However, as time has shown repeatedly, we’re all stuck on this hellride, and some of us are actively trying to get off. As a result, the album isn’t just contemporary to 1992; it’s relevant today as well.</p>
<p>“Landlords and power whores, on my people, they took turns. Dispute the suits, I ignite and then watch ‘em burn.”</p>
<p>These lyrics feel as relevant today as they did back then—at least, I assume so, since I wasn’t born when the album came out. <del>Hi Bert, feel old?</del></p>
<p>Even Killing In The Name is as pertinent as ever, especially in light of yet another black person being murdered by the police for merely existing.</p>
<p>The album is filled with lyrics that hit as hard today as they did back then. The music itself also hits just as hard, with riffs that get stuck in your head and what I assume is very experimental sounds. Proving that good music stays good.</p>
<p>Liked</p>
<ul>
<li>Unique soundscape, with lots of electric guitar played by someone who is an absolute master of their craft. I genuinely didn’t know someone could be that skilled at an instrument.</li>
<li>They obviously had fun writing the music, and you can hear that in every aspect.</li>
</ul>
<p>Disliked</p>
<ul>
<li>Some songs don’t carve out their own unique musical identities and can blend together.</li>
</ul>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>I don’t like giving scores, so I won’t. A great album that, unfortunately, remains as relevant today as it was back then.
This album should be mandatory listening in 2024.</p>
