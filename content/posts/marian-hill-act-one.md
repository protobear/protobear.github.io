Act One

Marian Hill is a duo I was familiar with primarily because of the song “Down,” which opens this album. “Down” is a standout track with its catchy chopped vocals and trap beat, and it’s no surprise it’s a favourite of mine on Apple Music.

As I continued through the album, I was initially concerned that the rest of the tracks might not match the high bar set by “Down.” However, “Talk to Me” quickly eased that worry with its intriguing saxophone sounds, setting a promising tone for the album that it ultimately could not entirely maintain.

Rather than focusing on lyrical depth, the album places its emphasis on creating a mood and incorporating unique sounds into each song. For example, “I Know Why” features a distinctive waterdrop effect. However, some tracks take a while to find their groove, and by the time they do, they’re nearly over. “Good” is a prime example, leaving you wanting more just as it hits its stride.

The vocals often serve as another instrument, blending seamlessly with the music, making it clear that the focus is more on the atmosphere than the lyrics themselves. Occasionally, though, the lyrics and music feel out of sync, as if they were crafted separately without fully meshing. This can range from mildly annoying to quite distracting, possibly due to a mixing issue.

The album maintains a laid-back yet engaging mood with a slightly dark edge. Marian Hill clearly aims to entertain, guiding listeners through various musical ideas. The experience somewhat dampened by weak vocal performance. Overall, “Act One” opens strong, falters somewhat in the middle, but manages to close on a high note. Highlights include “Down,” “Take Your Time,” “I Want You,” and “Mistaken.”
