+++


After what has been an incredible journey spanning nearly a decade, I want to share that I’ll be stepping down as administrator of r/MMORPG one year from now on March 13th, 2026. This date will mark exactly 10 years since I first became involved with this subreddit, and it feels like the right moment to pass the torch.


The Journey

When I started this role, I was in an entirely different phase of my life. Since then, I’ve graduated, found a partner, worked as a software engineer, and now teach in higher education. Life has a funny way of evolving, and while my love for MMORPGs hasn’t diminished, the time has come to make space for these other aspects of my life. Put simply, these parts of my life are taking up more space, and I no longer feel like I’m giving r/MMORPG the attention it deserves and requires.


Looking Back

Over the years, we’ve achieved some things I’m genuinely proud of. We’ve significantly enhanced our approach to community moderation, particularly in combating toxicity. The AMAs and developer spotlights we established became something special, fostering what I hope were genuine connections between creators and players.

One of the most humbling aspects of this role has been the unexpected connections. From being asked to playtest titles, getting cold calls from devs because they wanted my opinion or a sanity check, to receiving what have become my favorite socks from Corepunk – this journey has been filled with surreal moments that I’ll always cherish.


Looking Forward

Regarding succession, I’m currently looking at our moderator team to find someone who will follow me and ensure a smooth transition. I have some potential candidates in mind who I believe would excel in this role, but it’s still too early to finalize anything. It might even be too soon to announce that I’m leaving over a year in advance, but I feel like sharing this now will make it impossible for me to change my mind, thus making the decision final.

For those wondering, no, I’m not vanishing entirely. I’ll still be around, likely maintaining a moderator role for a while. The Discord server, being partnered, prevents ownership transference, but honestly? That’s fine by me. This community has been such a significant part of my life that stepping away completely would feel impossible.


The Road Ahead

My greatest hope for r/MMORPG’s future is that whoever takes the helm brings their own fresh passion and vision. While I’m proud of what we’ve built together, I don’t want my successor to simply maintain the status quo. I hope they’ll bring new ideas and their own flavor to the role, just as I did when I started.

In the coming year I hope to share a few insights I've made while I still have your ear, well, I guess, eyes? Continue to set some changes in motion that will help developers and creators alike to get more eyeballs on their content and hopefully find more cool stuff for people to enjoy.

To everyone who has been part of this journey – whether you’ve been here since the beginning or joined recently – thank you. You’ve made this decade not just memorable, but truly special.
